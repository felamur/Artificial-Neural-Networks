Abstract— In this paper, chest x-ray dataset is trained using three different neural network models. Dataset includes white and black x-ray images. Models used for this project are: Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and lastly Multi-layer Perception Neural Network. Purpose of this is experiment is classifying and finding out which patients has pneumonia without getting help from a doctor. For the experiments python and its libraries were used.
Keywords— Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Multi-layer Perception Neural Network, pneumonia, python, x-ray.
